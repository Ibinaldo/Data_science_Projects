# Analyzing World Demographic Information Using SQL

## Background
[The world factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) provides information on pertinent details such as history, people, government, economy, geography and a variety of other information for over 200 countries around the globe. With this information, one can gain insights into a country's economic, social and other standings. This can be very useful for a variety of reasons; For businesses it might give an overview of the economy and possibly reveal any opportunities for business. It can also provide information for travelers seeking to explore new domains.

## Project Goal
In this project, I will analyze this data using SQL. I aim to achieve the following:

1. Demonstrate how SQL can be used within a Jupyter notebook
2. Extract insights from data

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/geraldb/talks/blob/master/factbook.md).
