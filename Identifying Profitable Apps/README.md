# Analyzing Profitable Mobile App Profiles for the App and Google Play Store

An app is essentially a piece of software that can run locally on your device, as well as through a web browser. Most apps can be found in online repositories such as *Google Play Store*, *Amazon Appstore* and *The App Store* for apple products. Mobile apps especially are useful in increasing customer loyalty because it allows business to communicate directly with their customers via in-app purchases, ads, promotions and notifications.

## What influences App engagement
Understanding the factors that result in increased user engagement is crucial to the success of any company. Since a large majority of apps are free to download, revenue is influenced by the number of app users. Therefore my mission is to analyze data to identify characteristics that are most likely to attract more users to an app.

## Data Source
There currently over 2 million IOS app available on the App store, and over 2 million android apps on Google Play store making them one of the largest repositories for app. The data sets used in this study were obtained from
1.     [Google Play Store data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and
2.     [App Store data](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). They contain data on about 10,000 Android apps from the Google Play store, and 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store respectively.

In this project I will focus on English Apps which are free.

# Methodology
1. The data is first loaded into tables, then inspected for erroneous and duplicate data values
2. Will isolate fee, English apps for further analysis
3. Create relative frequency tables for the different app types to identify trends in the app types most common within these repositories
4. Compute the average user engagement to identify patterns and find correlations to the relative frequency


# Conclusions
We will determine which app types are more likely to gain a good amount of interaction, as well as possible niche markets to target
